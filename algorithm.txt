Add the event listener to userRock. On click do the following: 
    Assign the value of userDecision to 'rock'

    Display the rock image in the user section. 

    Call the getComputerChoice() function. Assign the output to cpuDecision.

    Call cpuDisplay function. Passing it the cpuDecision as the argument. 

    Call the function playRound. Pass the userDecision and cpuDecision into the function as arguments.

Add the event listener to userPaper. On click do the following: 
    Assign the value of userDecision to 'paper'

    Display the paper image in the user section. 

    Call the getComputerChoice() function. Assign the output to cpuDecision.

    Call cpuDisplay function. Passing it the cpuDecision as the argument. 

    Call the function playRound. Pass the userDecision and cpuDecision into the function as arguments

Add the event listener to userScissors. On click do the following: 
    Assign the value of userDecision to 'scissors'

    Display the scissors image in the user section. 

    Call the getComputerChoice() function. Assign the output to cpuDecision.

    Call cpuDisplay function. Passing it the cpuDecision as the argument. 

    Call the function playRound. Pass the userDecision and cpuDecision into the function as argument.




function: getComputerChoice 
    When called randomly returns rock, paper or Scissors

    Create a variable of type let called cpuRand and assign it a random value between 1 to 3 using the previously written random function 

    If cpuRand is 1, assign the cpu decision as rock and return rock 

    If cpuRand is 2, assign the cpu decision as paper and return paper

    If cpuRand is 3, assign the cpu decision as paper 


function: playRound
    When called, determine if the user or cpu won the round

    Accepts two parameters, userSelection and cpuSelection

    If userSelection and cpuSelection are equal
        ->then return that it was a tie

    else if userSelection is rock and cpuSelection is scissors 
    | or userSelection is paper and cpuSelection is rock 
    | or userSelection is scissors and cpuSelection is paper: 
    -> return that the user won the round 
    -> Increment userWins by 1

    else if userSelection is rock and cpuSelection is paper
    | or userSelection is paper and cpuSelection is scissors
    | or else if userSelection is scissors and cpuSelection is rock
        -> return that the user won the round 
        -> Increment cpuWins by 1

function: cpuDisplay
    Displays the cpu image corresponding to the cpu's decision

    Accepts a single parameter, cpuSelection. 

    if cpuSelection is rock 
        -> Display rock image

    else if cpuSelection is paper
        -> Display paper image
    
    else 
        -> Display scissors image

function: winner
    Turns on/off the lights corresponding to the number of wins, displays a message if the cpu or user has won their 3rd game

    Accepts two paramaters, userWins and cpuWins


    if userWins is equal to one
        -> userScore1 background color is set to red

    elseif userWins is equal to two
        -> userScore2 background color is set to red

    elseif userWins is equal to three
        -> userScore3 background color is set to red
        -> message that the user has won

    if cpuWins is equal to one
        -> cpuScore1 background color is set to red

    elseif userWins is equal to two
        -> cpuScore2 background color is set to red

    elseif userWins is equal to three
        -> cpuScore3 background color is set to red
        -> Message that the cpu has won 


Include a playAgain/reset button and function?

function random(low = 0, high) {
      return low + Math.round(Math.random() * (high - low));
    }
