create a variable of type const called userRock which has an initial value of the userRock button (getElementById)

create a variable of type const called userPaper which has an initial value of the userPaper button (getElementById)

create a variable of type const called userScissors which has an initial value of the userScissors button (getElementById)

create a variable of type let called userWins with an initial value of zero. Used to store the number of rounds the user has won. 

create a variable of type let called cpuWins with an initial value of zero. Used to store the number of rounds the cpu has won. 

create a variable of type let called userDecision. Do not assign an initial value. 

create a variable of type let called cpuDecision. Do not assign an initial value. 

Add the event listener to userRock. On click do the following: 
    Assign the value of userDecision to 'rock'

    Call the getComputerChoice() function. Assign the output to cpuDecision.

    Call the function playRound. Pass the userDecision and cpuDecision into the function as arguments.

Add the event listener to userPaper. On click do the following: 
    Assign the value of userDecision to 'paper'

    Call the getComputerChoice() function. Assign the output to cpuDecision.

    Call the function playRound. Pass the userDecision and cpuDecision into the function as arguments

Add the event listener to userScissors. On click do the following: 
    Assign the value of userDecision to 'scissors'

    Call the getComputerChoice() function. Assign the output to cpuDecision.

    Call the function playRound. Pass the userDecision and cpuDecision into the function as argument.




function: getComputerChoice 
When called randomly returns rock, paper or Scissors

Create a variable of type let called cpuRand and assign it a random value between 1 to 3 using the previously written random function 

If cpuRand is 1, assign the cpu decision as rock and return rock 

If cpuRand is 2, assign the cpu decision as paper and return paper

If cpuRand is 3, assign the cpu decision as paper 


function: playRound
When called, determine if the user or cpu won the round

Accepts two parameters, userSelection and cpuSelection

If userSelection and cpuSelection are equal
    ->then return that it was a tie

else if userSelection is rock and cpuSelection is scissors 
| or userSelection is paper and cpuSelection is rock 
| or userSelection is scissors and cpuSelection is paper: 
   -> return that the user won the round 
   -> Increment userWins by 1

else if userSelection is rock and cpuSelection is paper
| or userSelection is paper and cpuSelection is scissors
| or else if userSelection is scissors and cpuSelection is rock
    -> return that the user won the round 
    -> Increment cpuWins by 1


function random(low = 0, high) {
      return low + Math.round(Math.random() * (high - low));
    }
