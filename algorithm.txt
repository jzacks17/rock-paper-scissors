create a variable of type const called play which has an initial value of the buttonPlay button(getElementById)

create a variable of type const called playAgain which has an initial value of the button buttonPlayAgain (getElementById)

create a variable of type const called choose which has an initial value of the three choose buttons (querySelectorAll)

create a variable of type let called userWins with an initial value of zero. Used to store the number of rounds the user has won. 

create a variable of type let called cpuWins with an initial value of zero. Used to store the number of rounds the cpu has won. 

create a variable of type let called userDecision. Do not assign an initial value. Used to store the user's decision.

create a variable of type let called cpuDecision. Do not assign an initial value. Used to store the cpu's decision.

Create variables for the score buttons: 
type const called userScore1 which has an initial value of the userScore1 button (getElementById)
type const called userScore2 which has an initial value of the userScore2 button (getElementById)
type const called userScore3 which has an initial value of the userScore3 button (getElementById)

type const called cpuScore1 which has an initial value of the cpuScore1 button (getElementById)
type const called cpuScore2 which has an initial value of the cpuScore2 button (getElementById)
type const called cpuScore3 which has an initial value of the cpuScore3 button (getElementById)

create variables for popup windows: 
type let called playPopUp which has an initial value of "open"
type let called playAgainPopUp which has an initial value of "closed"


Add the event listener to play. On click: 
-> Set display of the play popup to none.
-> Set playPopUp equal to "closed" 


Add the event listener to choose for each choice. On click call playRound().  


Add the event listener to playAgain. On click: 
-> Set display of the playAgain popup to none. 
-> Set value of playAgainPopUp to "closed" 
-> Set all the score lights color to white
-> set userWins to zero
-> Set cpuWins to zero



function: playRound
    When called, plays the round by calling the auxilliary functions. 

    Check to see if a popup is open:
    -> If a popup is open don't allow the round to be played (return;);
    
    Assign userDecision to the value of the button that was chosen.

    Set cpuDecision equal to the getComputerChoice() function

    call the display() function, passing it userDecision and cpuDecision

    Call the determineWinner() function, passing it userDecision and cpuDecision

    Call the function score(). Pass userWins and cpuWins into the function as arguments



function: getComputerChoice 
    When called randomly returns rock, paper or Scissors

    Create a variable of type let called cpuRand and assign it a random value between 1 to 3 using the previously written random function 

    If cpuRand is 1, assign the cpu decision as rock and return rock 

    If cpuRand is 2, assign the cpu decision as paper and return paper

    If cpuRand is 3, assign the cpu decision as paper 


function: Display
    Displays the user and cpu image corresponding to the user's and cpu's decision

    Accepts two parameters, userSelection and cpuSelection.

    if userSelection is rock 
        -> Display rock image

    else if userSelection is paper
        -> Display paper image
    
    else 
        -> Display scissors image

    if cpuSelection is rock 
        -> Display rock image

    else if cpuSelection is paper
        -> Display paper image
    
    else 
        -> Display scissors image


function determineWinner
    Function that determines the winner of each round that is played 
    Accepts two parameters userSelection and cpuSelection

     If userSelection and cpuSelection are equal
        ->then return that it was a tie

    else if userSelection is rock and cpuSelection is scissors 
    | or userSelection is paper and cpuSelection is rock 
    | or userSelection is scissors and cpuSelection is paper: 
    -> return that the user won the round 
    -> Increment userWins by 1

    else if userSelection is rock and cpuSelection is paper
    | or userSelection is paper and cpuSelection is scissors
    | or else if userSelection is scissors and cpuSelection is rock
        -> return that the user won the round 
        -> Increment cpuWins by 1


function: score
    Turns on/off the lights corresponding to the number of wins, displays a message if the cpu or user has won their 3rd game

    Accepts two paramaters, userW and cpuW


    if userWins is equal to one
        -> userScore1 background color is set to red

    elseif userWins is equal to two
        -> userScore2 background color is set to red

    elseif userWins is equal to three
        -> userScore3 background color is set to red
        -> Set a message that the user has won
        -> Display the playAgain popup
        -> set value of playAgainPopUp to "open"


    if cpuWins is equal to one
        -> cpuScore1 background color is set to red

    elseif userWins is equal to two
        -> cpuScore2 background color is set to red

    elseif userWins is equal to three
        -> cpuScore3 background color is set to red
        -> Set a message that the cpu has won
        -> Display the playAgain popup
        -> set value of playAgainPopUp to "open"


Include a playAgain/reset button and function?

function random(low = 0, high) {
      return low + Math.round(Math.random() * (high - low));
    }
